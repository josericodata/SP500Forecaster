### **Predicting S&P 500 Stocks with ML**

**SP500Forecaster is a machine learning-powered stock price prediction app specifically designed for S&P 500 companies. Built with Python and Streamlit, it leverages historical stock data to forecast future trends and empower investors with data-driven insights.**

## üõ†Ô∏è **How It's Built**

SP500Forecaster is built with the following core frameworks and tools:

- **Streamlit** - To create an intuitive web interface
- **Yahoo Finance API (YFinance)** - To fetch up-to-date financial data
- **Statsmodels** - To implement the AutoReg time-series forecasting model
- **Plotly** - To generate dynamic and interactive financial charts
- **Pandas** - To manipulate and process financial datasets

## üßë‚Äçüíª **How It Works**

1. The user selects a stock ticker from the S&P 500 list.
2. Historical stock data is retrieved using the Yahoo Finance API.
3. The AutoReg (Auto Regressive) model is trained on two years of historical data.
4. The model generates forecasts for the next 5‚Äì180 days.
5. Results are displayed with interactive charts and tables.

## ‚ú® **Key Features**

- **Real-time S&P 500 stock data** - Access accurate and up-to-date information.
- **Interactive charts** - View historical trends and future predictions visually.
- **Custom prediction ranges** - Forecast stock prices for 5 to 180 days.
- **Downloadable CSV** - Save prediction results for further analysis.
- **User-friendly interface** - Accessible for novice and experienced users alike.

streamlit run 00_‚ÑπÔ∏è_Info.py
```

The app will be live at ```http://localhost:8501```

## üåü **Future Enhancements**

Planned improvements and new features include:

- **Integration of advanced ML models** (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) for better prediction accuracy.
- **Multi-stock analysis** to compare performance across different stocks.
- **Sector-based insights** to understand trends within specific industries.
